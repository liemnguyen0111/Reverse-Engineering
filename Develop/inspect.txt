1. Starting off with server.js file:
    +npm packages+
        - express : using this package to create a server
        - express-session :using this package to create a user session
    
    +passport+
        + Using file passport.js in the folder ./config
            +npm packages+
                - passport : this package allow to validate a user login.
                - passport-local : this use to create a local strategy of how we want to check 
                                    on the user before granting the access.
                
            + Using file that we created in the folder ../models
            (use strict - Allow the machine to throw an error when there is an bad syntax)
                +npm packages+
                    - fs (file sync) : use to read/write to a file.
                    - path : use to get the path of the file name.
                    - Sequelize : is a database ORM that is used to handle data in mysql.
                    
                - basename : telling the path npm package to use the basename or basically getting
                            the root name of the file on the machine.
                - env : grabbing the enviroment variable if existed or using the development variable  
                        in the config.json file located in the folder ./config
                - config : grabbing the variables that were created in the ./config/config.js
                - db : an empty object used to reserve the info after line 24

                - if the enviroment varialbe is available then create a new sequelize using 
                  the info stored in that variable else use the varialbe that was created in the    
                  config.json file in ./config folder.

                - then filter through all the file in the development folder and return any files
                  that the path is not starting with . or basename or .js extension
                - then loop through the array that we just filtered and create a new model and
                  store it in the db variable.

                - Object.keys(db) will allow us to grab each property name in the object and then 
                  loop through each property, then check if db[modelName].associate is true,
                  then set the db property into db[modelName].associate(db)
                
                - Assign sequelize into the sequelize property in db and Sequelize into the Sequelize 
                  property into Sequelize.
                
                - then export db out for passport.js to use
            
            - Telling the password to use the LocalStrategy to to the check and return the result
              whether depend on the check.

            - Export passport out for for server.js to use
        
        +Setting up port and require models for syncing+
            - Variable PORT create to store if there is any PORT available in the enviroment if not use port 8080
            - Variable db require the variable that was exported out from the ./models folder.

        +Middleware+
            - create an app and telling it to use express()
            - Telling app to accept urlencoded, json and use the public folder.
            - Telling app to use session to keep track of the user's login with 
              passport

        +Routes+
            + import the routes that we create in the ./routes folder
              
                +api-routes+
                    - Routes that created for user login/signup and grabbing user info.
                
                +html-routes+ (.html files located in the public folder)
                    +- Routes that created to return the html file to the user depend on 
                      the user status.
                        +login.html+ 
                            - login.js
                            - style.js
                        +signup.html+
                            - signup.js
                            - style.js
                        +members.html+
                            - member.js
                            - style.js
        
        +Create connection+
